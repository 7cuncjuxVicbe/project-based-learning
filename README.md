 Norma Din 6935 PDF Download - A Guide to Cold Bending of Flat Steel Products     
If you are looking for a reliable and comprehensive guide to cold bending of flat steel products, you may want to download the Norma Din 6935 PDF document. This document is based on the DIN 6935 standard, which is a German standard that applies to bent parts of flat steel products for use in steel construction and in general mechanical engineering. The document explains the method of calculation, the smallest permissible bending radius, the calculation of the stretched lengths, and the correction factor for determining the cutting lengths of bent workpieces. It also provides examples and tables for different materials, thicknesses, and bending angles.
     
Cold bending of flat steel products is a process that involves bending flat rolled steel, such as sheets, strips, wide flat steels, etc., without heating them. This process can produce various shapes and forms of steel products, such as angles, channels, beams, frames, etc. Cold bending can improve the strength and stiffness of the steel products, as well as reduce the material waste and fabrication cost. However, cold bending also introduces residual stresses and strains in the steel products, which can affect their performance and durability. Therefore, it is important to follow the proper guidelines and standards for cold bending of flat steel products, such as the DIN 6935 standard.
